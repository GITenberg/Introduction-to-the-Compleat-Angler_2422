<h1>ANDREW LANG&rsquo;S INTRODUCTION TO THE COMPLEAT ANGLER</h1>
<p>To write on Walton is, indeed, to hold a candle to the sun.&nbsp;
The editor has been content to give a summary of the chief or rather
the only known, events in Walton&rsquo;s long life, adding a notice
of his character as displayed in his Biographies and in <i>The Compleat
Angler</i>, with comments on the ancient and modern practice of fishing,
illustrated by passages from Walton&rsquo;s foregoers and contemporaries.&nbsp;
Like all editors of Walton, he owes much to his predecessors, Sir John
Hawkins, Oldys, Major, and, above all, to the learned Sir Harris Nicolas.</p>
<h2>HIS LIFE</h2>
<p>The few events in the long life of Izaak Walton have been carefully
investigated by Sir Harris Nicolas.&nbsp; All that can be extricated
from documents by the alchemy of research has been selected, and I am
unaware of any important acquisitions since Sir Harris Nicolas&rsquo;s
second edition of 1860.&nbsp; Izaak was of an old family of Staffordshire
yeomen, probably descendants of George Walton of Yoxhall, who died in
1571.&nbsp; Izaak&rsquo;s father was Jarvis Walton, who died in February
1595-6; of Izaak&rsquo;s mother nothing is known.&nbsp; Izaak himself
was born at Stafford, on August 9, 1593, and was baptized on September
21.&nbsp; He died on December 15, 1683, having lived in the reigns of
Elizabeth, James I., Charles I., under the Commonwealth, and under Charles
II.&nbsp; The anxious and changeful age through which he passed is in
contrast with his very pacific character and tranquil pursuits.</p>
<p>Of Walton&rsquo;s education nothing is known, except on the evidence
of his writings.&nbsp; He may have read Latin, but most of the books
he cites had English translations.&nbsp; Did he learn his religion from
&lsquo;his mother or his nurse&rsquo;?&nbsp; It will be seen that the
free speculation of his age left him untouched: perhaps his piety was
awakened, from childhood, under the instruction of a pious mother.&nbsp;
Had he been orphaned of both parents (as has been suggested) he might
have been less amenable to authority, and a less notable example of
the virtues which Anglicanism so vainly opposed to Puritanismism.&nbsp;
His literary beginnings are obscure.&nbsp; There exists a copy of a
work, <i>The Loves of Amos and Laura</i>, written by S. P., published
in 1613, and again in 1619.&nbsp; The edition of 1619 is dedicated to
&lsquo;Iz. Wa.&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thou being cause <i>it is as now it is</i>&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Dedication does not occur in the one imperfect known copy of
1613.&nbsp; Conceivably the words, &lsquo;as now it is&rsquo; refer
to the edition of 1619, which might have been emended by Walton&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; But there are no emendations, hence it is more probable
that Walton revised the poem in 1613, when he was a man of twenty, or
that he merely advised the author to publish:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For, hadst thou held thy tongue, by silence might<br />
These have been buried in oblivion&rsquo;s night.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S. P. also remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;No ill thing can be clothed in thy verse&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hence Izaak was already a rhymer, and a harmless one, under the Royal
Prentice, gentle King Jamie.</p>
<p>By this time Walton was probably settled in London.&nbsp; A deed
in the possession of his biographer, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s friend, Sir
John Hawkins, shows that, in 1614, Walton held half of a shop on the
north side of Fleet Street, two doors west of Chancery Lane: the other
occupant was a hosier.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholl has discovered that Walton
was made free of the Ironmongers&rsquo; Company on Nov. 12, 1618.&nbsp;
He is styled an Ironmonger in his marriage licence.&nbsp; The facts
are given in Mr. Marston&rsquo;s Life of Walton, prefixed to his edition
of <i>The Compleat Angler</i> (1888).&nbsp; It is odd that a prentice
ironmonger should have been a poet and a critic of poetry.&nbsp; Dr.
Donne, before 1614, was Vicar of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s in the West, and
in Walton had a parishioner, a disciple, and a friend.&nbsp; Izaak greatly
loved the society of the clergy: he connected himself with Episcopal
families, and had a natural taste for a Bishop.&nbsp; Through Donne,
perhaps, or it may be in converse across the counter, he made acquaintance
with Hales of Eton, Dr. King, and Sir Henry Wotton, himself an angler,
and one who, like Donne and Izaak, loved a ghost story, and had several
in his family.&nbsp; Drayton, the river-poet, author of the <i>Polyolbion</i>,
is also spoken of by Walton as &lsquo;my old deceased friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On Dec. 27, 1626, Walton married, at Canterbury, Rachel Floud, a
niece, on the maternal side, by several descents, of Cranmer, the famous
Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; The Cranmers were intimate with the
family of the judicious Hooker, and Walton was again connected with
kinsfolk of that celebrated divine.&nbsp; Donne died in 1631, leaving
to Walton, and to other friends, a bloodstone engraved with Christ crucified
on an anchor: the seal is impressed on Walton&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; When
Donne&rsquo;s poems were published in 1633, Walton added commendatory
verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As all lament<br />
(Or should) this general cause of discontent.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parenthetic &lsquo;or should&rsquo; is much in Walton&rsquo;s
manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Witness my mild pen, not used to upbraid the world,&rsquo;
is also a pleasant and accurate piece of self-criticism.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am his convert,&rsquo; Walton exclaims.&nbsp; In a citation from a manuscript
which cannot be found, and perhaps never existed, Walton is spoken of
as &lsquo;a very sweet poet in his youth, and more than all in matters
of love.&rsquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>&nbsp;
Donne had been in the same case: he, or Time, may have converted Walton
from amorous ditties.&nbsp; Walton, in an edition of Donne&rsquo;s poems
of 1635, writes of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This book (dry emblem) which begins<br />
With love; but ends with tears and sighs for sins.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The preacher and his convert had probably a similar history of the
heart: as we shall see, Walton, like the Cyclops, had known love.&nbsp;
Early in 1639, Wotton wrote to Walton about a proposed Life of Donne,
to be written by himself, and hoped &lsquo;to enjoy your own ever welcome
company in the approaching time of the <i>Fly</i> and the <i>Cork</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Wotton was a fly-fisher; the cork, or float, or &lsquo;trembling quill,&rsquo;
marks Izaak for the bottom-fisher he was.&nbsp; Wotton died in December
1639; Walton prefixed his own Life of Donne to that divine&rsquo;s sermons
in 1640.&nbsp; He says, in the Dedication of the reprint of 1658, that
&lsquo;it had the approbation of our late learned and eloquent King,&rsquo;
the martyred Charles I.&nbsp; Living in, or at the corner of Chancery
Lane, Walton is known to have held parochial office: he was even elected
&lsquo;scavenger.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had the misfortune to lose seven children&mdash;of
whom the last died in 1641&mdash;his wife, and his mother-in-law.&nbsp;
In 1644 he left Chancery Lane, and probably retired from trade.&nbsp;
He was, of course, a Royalist.&nbsp; Speaking of the entry of the Scots,
who came, as one of them said, &lsquo;for the goods,&mdash;and chattels
of the English,&rsquo; he remarks, &lsquo;I saw and suffered by it.&rsquo;
<a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp; He also mentions
that he &lsquo;saw&rsquo; shops shut by their owners till Laud should
be put to death, in January 1645.&nbsp; In his Life of Sanderson, Walton
vouches for an anecdote of &lsquo;the knowing and conscientious King,&rsquo;
Charles, who, he says, meant to do public penance for Strafford&rsquo;s
death, and for the abolishing of Episcopacy in Scotland.&nbsp; But the
condition, &lsquo;peaceable possession of the Crown,&rsquo; was not
granted to Charles, nor could have been granted to a prince who wished
to reintroduce Bishops in Scotland.&nbsp; Walton had his information
from Dr. Morley.&nbsp; On Nov. 25, 1645, Walton probably wrote, though
John Marriott signed, an Address to the Reader, printed, in 1646, with
Quarles&rsquo;s <i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Eclogues</i>.&nbsp; The piece is
a little idyll in prose, and &lsquo;angle, lines, and flies&rsquo; are
not omitted in the description of &lsquo;the fruitful month of May,&rsquo;
while Pan is implored to restore Arcadian peace to Britannia, &lsquo;and
grant that each honest shepherd may again sit under his own vine and
fig-tree, and feed his own flock,&rsquo; when the King comes, no doubt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;About&rsquo; 1646 Walton married Anne, half-sister of Bishop
Ken, a lady &lsquo;of much Christian meeknesse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir Harris
Nicolas thinks that he only visited Stafford occasionally, in these
troubled years.&nbsp; He mentions fishing in &lsquo;Shawford brook&rsquo;;
he was likely to fish wherever there was water, and the brook flowed
through land which, as Mr. Marston shows, he acquired about 1656.&nbsp;
In 1650 a child was born to Walton in Clerkenwell; it died, but another,
Isaac, was born in September 1651.&nbsp; In 1651 he published the <i>Reliquiae
Wottonianae</i>, with a Memoir of Sir Henry Wotton.&nbsp; The knight
had valued Walton&rsquo;s company as a cure for &lsquo;those splenetic
vapours that are called hypochondriacal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Worcester fight was on September 3, 1651; the king was defeated,
and fled, escaping, thanks to a stand made by Wogan, and to the loyalty
of Mistress Jane Lane, and of many other faithful adherents.&nbsp; A
jewel of Charles&rsquo;s, the lesser George, was preserved by Colonel
Blague, who intrusted it to Mr. Barlow of Blore Pipe House, in Staffordshire.&nbsp;
Mr. Barlow gave it to Mr. Milward, a Royalist prisoner in Stafford,
and he, in turn, intrusted it to Walton, who managed to convey it to
Colonel Blague in the Tower.&nbsp; The colonel escaped, and the George
was given back to the king.&nbsp; Ashmole, who tells the story, mentions
Walton as &lsquo;well beloved of all good men.&rsquo;&nbsp; This incident
is, perhaps, the only known adventure in the long life of old Izaak.&nbsp;
The peaceful angler, with a royal jewel in his pocket, must have encountered
many dangers on the highway.&nbsp; He was a man of sixty when he published
his <i>Compleat Angler</i> in 1653, and so secured immortality.&nbsp;
The quiet beauties of his manner in his various biographies would only
have made him known to a few students, who could never have recognised
Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;quaint, old, cruel coxcomb&rsquo; in their author.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The whole discourse is a kind of picture of my own disposition,
at least of my disposition in such days and times as I allow myself
when honest Nat. and R. R. and I go a-fishing together.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Izaak speaks of the possibility that his book may reach a second edition.&nbsp;
There are now editions more than a hundred!&nbsp; Waltonians should
read Mr. Thomas Westwood&rsquo;s Preface to his <i>Chronicle of the
Compleat Angler</i>: it is reprinted in Mr. Marston&rsquo;s edition.&nbsp;
Mr. Westwood learned to admire Walton at the feet of Charles Lamb:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;No fisher,<br />
But a well-wisher<br />
To the game,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as Scott describes himself.&nbsp; <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a></p>
<p>Lamb recommended Walton to Coleridge; &lsquo;it breathes the very
spirit of innocence, purity, and simplicity of heart; . . . it would
sweeten a man&rsquo;s temper at any time to read it; it would Christianise
every angry, discordant passion; pray make yourself acquainted with
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Oct. 28, 1796.)&nbsp; According to Mr. Westwood, Lamb
had &lsquo;an early copy,&rsquo; found in a repository of marine stores,
but not, even then, to be bought a bargain.&nbsp; Mr. Westwood fears
that Lamb&rsquo;s copy was only Hawkins&rsquo;s edition of 1760.&nbsp;
The original is extremely scarce.&nbsp; Mr. Locker had a fine copy;
there is another in the library of Dorchester House: both are in their
primitive livery of brown sheep, or calf.&nbsp; The book is one which
only the wealthy collector can hope, with luck, to call his own.&nbsp;
A small octavo, sold at eighteen-pence, <i>The Compleat Angler</i> was
certain to be thumbed into nothingness, after enduring much from May
showers, July suns, and fishy companionship.&nbsp; It is almost a wonder
that any examples of Walton&rsquo;s and Bunyan&rsquo;s first editions
have survived into our day.&nbsp; The little volume was meant to find
a place in the bulging pockets of anglers, and was well adapted to that
end.&nbsp; The work should be reprinted in a similar format: quarto
editions are out of place.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the book, the <i>fata libelli</i>, have been traced
by Mr. Westwood.&nbsp; There are several misprints (later corrected)
in the earliest copies, as (p. 88) &lsquo;Fordig&rsquo; for &lsquo;Fordidg,&rsquo;
(p. 152) &lsquo;Pudoch&rsquo; for &lsquo;Pudock.&rsquo;&nbsp; The appearance
of the work was advertised in <i>The Perfect Diurnal</i> (May 9-16),
and in No. 154 of <i>The Mercurius Politicus</i> (May 19-26), also in
an almanack for 1654.&nbsp; Izaak, or his publisher Marriott, cunningly
brought out the book at a season when men expect the Mayfly.&nbsp; Just
a month before, Oliver Cromwell had walked into the House of Commons,
in a plain suit of black clothes, with grey stockings.&nbsp; His language,
when he spoke, was reckoned unparliamentary (as it undeniably was),
and he dissolved the Long Parliament.&nbsp; While Marriott was advertising
Walton&rsquo;s work, Cromwell was making a Parliament of Saints, &lsquo;faithful,
fearing God, and hating covetousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a good description
of Izaak, but he was not selected.&nbsp; In the midst of revolutions
came <i>The Compleat Angler</i> to the light, a possession for ever.&nbsp;
Its original purchasers are not likely to have taken a hand in Royalist
plots or saintly conventicles.&nbsp; They were peaceful men.&nbsp; A
certain Cromwellian trooper, Richard Franck, was a better angler than
Walton, and he has left to us the only contemporary and contemptuous
criticism of his book: to this we shall return, but anglers, as a rule,
unlike Franck, must have been for the king, and on Izaak&rsquo;s side
in controversy.</p>
<p>Walton brought out a second edition in 1655.&nbsp; He rewrote the
book, adding more than a third, suppressing <i>Viator</i>, and introducing
<i>Venator</i>.&nbsp; New plates were added, and, after the manner of
the time, commendatory verses.&nbsp; A third edition appeared in 1661,
a fourth (published by Simon Gape, not by Marriott) came out in 1664,
a fifth in 1668 (counting Gape&rsquo;s of 1664 as a new edition), and
in 1676, the work, with treatises by Venables and Charles Cotton, was
given to the world as <i>The Universal Angler</i>.&nbsp; Five editions
in twelve years is not bad evidence of Walton&rsquo;s popularity.&nbsp;
But times now altered.&nbsp; Walton is really an Elizabethan: he has
the quaint freshness, the apparently artless music of language of the
great age.&nbsp; He is a friend of &lsquo;country contents&rsquo;: no
lover of the town, no keen student of urban ways and mundane men.&nbsp;
A new taste, modelled on that of the wits of Louis XIV., had come in:
we are in the period of Dryden, and approaching that of Pope.</p>
<p>There was no new edition of Walton till Moses Browne (by Johnson&rsquo;s
desire) published him, with &lsquo;improvements,&rsquo; in 1750.&nbsp;
Then came Hawkins&rsquo;s edition in 1760.&nbsp; Johnson said of Hawkins,
&lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, I believe him to be an honest man at the bottom;
but, to be sure, he is penurious, and he is mean, and it must be owned
he has a degree of brutality, and a tendency to savageness, that cannot
easily be defended.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was hardly the editor for Izaak!&nbsp; However, Hawkins, probably
by aid of Oldys the antiquary (as Mr. Marston shows), laid a good foundation
for a biography of Walton.&nbsp; Errors he made, but Sir Harris Nicolas
has corrected them.&nbsp; Johnson himself reckoned Walton&rsquo;s <i>Lives</i>
as &lsquo;one of his most favourite books.&rsquo;&nbsp; He preferred
the life of Donne, and justly complained that Walton&rsquo;s story of
Donne&rsquo;s vision of his absent wife had been left out of a modern
edition.&nbsp; He explained Walton&rsquo;s friendship with persons of
higher rank by his being &lsquo;a great panegyrist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The eighteenth century, we see, came back to Walton, as the nineteenth
has done.&nbsp; He was precisely the author to suit Charles Lamb.&nbsp;
He was reprinted again and again, and illustrated by Stoddart and others.&nbsp;
Among his best editors are Major (1839), &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo; (1853),
Nicolas (1836, 1860), and Mr. Marston (1888).</p>
<p>The only contemporary criticism known to me is that of Richard Franck,
who had served with Cromwell in Scotland, and, not liking the aspect
of changing times, returned to the north, and fished from the Esk to
Strathnaver.&nbsp; In 1658 he wrote his <i>Northern Memoirs</i>, an
itinerary of sport, heavily cumbered by dull reflections and pedantic
style.&nbsp; Franck, however, was a practical angler, especially for
salmon, a fish of which Walton knew nothing: he also appreciated the
character of the great Montrose.&nbsp; He went to America, wrote a wild
cosmogonic work, and <i>The Admirable and Indefatigable Adventures of
the Nine Pious Pilgrims</i> (one pilgrim catches a trout!) (London,
1708).&nbsp; The <i>Northern Memoirs</i> of 1658 were not published
till 1694.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott edited a new issue, in 1821, and defended
Izaak from the strictures of the salmon-fisher.&nbsp; Izaak, says Franck,
&lsquo;lays the stress of his arguments upon other men&rsquo;s observations,
wherewith he stuffs his indigested octavo; so brings himself under the
angler&rsquo;s censure and the common calamity of a plagiary, to be
pitied (poor man) for his loss of time, in scribbling and transcribing
other men&rsquo;s notions. . . . I remember in Stafford, I urged his
own argument upon him, that pickerel weed of itself breeds pickerel
(pike).&rsquo;&nbsp; Franck proposed a rational theory, &lsquo;which
my Compleat Angler no sooner deliberated, but dropped his argument,
and leaves Gesner to defend it, so huffed away. . . . &rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;So note, the true character of an industrious angler more deservedly
falls upon Merrill and Faulkner, or rather Izaak Ouldham, a man that
fished salmon with but three hairs at hook, whose collections and experiments
were lost with himself,&rsquo;&mdash;a matter much to be regretted.&nbsp;
It will be observed, of course, that hair was then used, and gut is
first mentioned for angling purposes by Mr. Pepys.&nbsp; Indeed, the
flies which Scott was hunting for when he found the lost Ms. of the
first part of <i>Waverley</i> are tied on horse-hairs.&nbsp; They are
in the possession of the descendants of Scott&rsquo;s friend, Mr. William
Laidlaw.&nbsp; The curious angler, consulting Franck, will find that
his salmon flies are much like our own, but less variegated.&nbsp; Scott
justly remarks that, while Walton was habit and repute a bait-fisher,
even Cotton knows nothing of salmon.&nbsp; Scott wished that Walton
had made the northern tour, but Izaak would have been sadly to seek,
running after a fish down a gorge of the Shin or the Brora, and the
discomforts of the north would have finished his career.&nbsp; In Scotland
he would not have found fresh sheets smelling of lavender.</p>
<p>Walton was in London &lsquo;in the dangerous year 1655.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He speaks of his meeting Bishop Sanderson there, &lsquo;in sad-coloured
clothes, and, God knows, far from being costly.&rsquo;&nbsp; The friends
were driven by wind and rain into &lsquo;a cleanly house, where we had
bread, cheese, ale, and a fire, for our ready money.&nbsp; The rain
and wind were so obliging to me, as to force our stay there for at least
an hour, to my great content and advantage; for in that time he made
to me many useful observations of the present times with much clearness
and conscientious freedom.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a year of Republican
and Royalist conspiracies: the clergy were persecuted and banished from
London.</p>
<p>No more is known of Walton till the happy year 1660, when the king
came to his own again, and Walton&rsquo;s Episcopal friends to their
palaces.&nbsp; Izaak produced an &lsquo;Eglog,&rsquo; on May 29:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The king!&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s returned!&nbsp;
And now<br />
Let&rsquo;s banish all sad thoughts, and sing:<br />
We have our laws, and have our king.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Izaak was so eccentric as to go to bed sober on that glorious
twenty-ninth of May, I greatly misjudge him.&nbsp; But he grew elderly.&nbsp;
In 1661 he chronicles the deaths of &lsquo;honest Nat. and R. Roe,&mdash;they
are gone, and with them most of my pleasant hours, even as a shadow
that passeth away, and returns not.&rsquo;&nbsp; On April 17, 1662,
Walton lost his second wife: she died at Worcester, probably on a visit
to Bishop Morley.&nbsp; In the same year, the bishop was translated
to Winchester, where the palace became Izaak&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; The
Itchen (where, no doubt, he angled with worm) must have been his constant
haunt.&nbsp; He was busy with his Life of Richard Hooker (1665).&nbsp;
The peroration, as it were, was altered and expanded in 1670, and this
is but one example of Walton&rsquo;s care of his periods.&nbsp; One
beautiful passage he is known to have rewritten several times, till
his ear was satisfied with its cadences.&nbsp; In 1670 he published
his Life of George Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish, if God shall be so
pleased, that I may be so happy as to die like him.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
1673, in a Dedication of the third edition of <i>Reliquiae Wottonianae</i>,
Walton alludes to his friendship with a much younger and gayer man than
himself, Charles Cotton (born 1630), the friend of Colonel Richard Lovelace,
and of Sir John Suckling: the translator of Scarron&rsquo;s travesty
of Virgil, and of Montaigne&rsquo;s <i>Essays</i>.&nbsp; Cotton was
a roisterer, a man at one time deep in debt, but he was a Royalist,
a scholar, and an angler.&nbsp; The friendship between him and Walton
is creditable to the freshness of the old man and to the kindness of
the younger, who, to be sure, laughed at Izaak&rsquo;s heavily dubbed
London flies.&nbsp; &lsquo;In him,&rsquo; says Cotton, &lsquo;I have
the happiness to know the worthiest man, and to enjoy the best and the
truest friend any man ever had.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are reminded of Johnson
with Langton and Topham Beauclerk.&nbsp; Meanwhile Izaak the younger
had grown up, was educated under Dr. Fell at Christ Church, and made
the Grand Tour in 1675, visiting Rome and Venice.&nbsp; In March 1676
he proceeded M.A. and took Holy Orders.&nbsp; In this year Cotton wrote
his treatise on fly-fishing, to be published with Walton&rsquo;s new
edition; and the famous fishing house on the Dove, with the blended
initials of the two friends, was built.&nbsp; In 1678, Walton wrote
his Life of Sanderson. . . . &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis now too late to wish
that my life may be like his, for I am in the eighty-fifth year of my
age, but I humbly beseech Almighty God that my death may be; and do
as earnestly beg of every reader to say Amen!&rsquo;&nbsp; He wrote,
in 1678, a preface to <i>Thealma and Clearchus</i> (1683).&nbsp; The
poem is attributed to John Chalkhill, a Fellow of Winchester College,
who died, a man of eighty, in 1679.&nbsp; Two of his songs are in <i>The
Compleat Angler</i>.&nbsp; Probably the attribution is right: Chalkhill&rsquo;s
tomb commemorates a man after Walton&rsquo;s own heart, but some have
assigned the volume to Walton himself.&nbsp; Chalkhill is described,
on the title-page, as &lsquo;an acquaintant and friend of Edmund Spencer,&rsquo;
which is impossible. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a></p>
<p>On August 9, 1683, Walton wrote his will, &lsquo;in the neintyeth
year of my age, and in perfect memory, for which praised be God.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He professes the Anglican faith, despite &lsquo;a very long and very
trew friendship for some of the Roman Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; His worldly
estate he has acquired &lsquo;neither by falsehood or flattery or the
extreme crewelty of the law of this nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; His property
was in two houses in London, the lease of Norington farm, a farm near
Stafford, besides books, linen, and a hanging cabinet inscribed with
his name, now, it seems, in the possession of Mr. Elkin Mathews.&nbsp;
A bequest is made of money for coals to the poor of Stafford, &lsquo;every
last weike in Janewary, or in every first weike in Febrewary; I say
then, because I take that time to be the hardest and most pinching times
with pore people.&rsquo;&nbsp; To the Bishop of Winchester he bequeathed
a ring with the posy, &lsquo;A Mite for a Million.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
are other bequests, including ten pounds to &lsquo;my old friend, Mr.
Richard Marriott,&rsquo; Walton&rsquo;s bookseller.&nbsp; This good
man died in peace with his publisher, leaving him also a ring.&nbsp;
A ring was left to a lady of the Portsmouth family, &lsquo;Mrs. Doro.
Wallop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Walton died, at the house of his son-in-law, Dr. Hawkins, in Winchester,
on Dec. 15, 1683: he is buried in the south aisle of the Cathedral.&nbsp;
The Cathedral library possesses many of Walton&rsquo;s books, with his
name written in them. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
His <i>Eusebius</i> (1636) contains, on the fly-leaf, repetitions, in
various forms, of one of his studied passages.&nbsp; Simple as he seems,
he is a careful artist in language.</p>
<p>Such are the scanty records, and scantier relics, of a very long
life.&nbsp; Circumstances and inclination combined to make Walpole choose
the <i>fallentis semita vitae</i>.&nbsp; Without ambition, save to be
in the society of good men, he passed through turmoil, ever companioned
by content.&nbsp; For him existence had its trials: he saw all that
he held most sacred overthrown; laws broken up; his king publicly murdered;
his friends outcasts; his worship proscribed; he himself suffered in
property from the raid of the Kirk into England.&nbsp; He underwent
many bereavements: child after child he lost, but content he did not
lose, nor sweetness of heart, nor belief.&nbsp; His was one of those
happy characters which are never found disassociated from unquestioning
faith.&nbsp; Of old he might have been the ancient religious Athenian
in the opening of Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i>, or Virgil&rsquo;s aged
gardener.&nbsp; The happiness of such natures would be incomplete without
religion, but only by such tranquil and blessed souls can religion be
accepted with no doubt or scruple, no dread, and no misgiving.&nbsp;
In his Preface to <i>Thealma and Clearchus</i> Walton writes, and we
may use his own words about his own works: &lsquo;The Reader will here
find such various events and rewards of innocent Truth and undissembled
Honesty, as is like to leave in him (if he be a good-natured reader)
more sympathising and virtuous impressions, than ten times so much time
spent in impertinent, critical, and needless disputes about religion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Walton relied on authority; on &lsquo;a plain, unperplexed catechism.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In an age of the strangest and most dissident theological speculations,
an age of Quakers, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Fifth Monarchy Men, Covenanters,
Independents, Gibbites, Presbyterians, and what not, Walton was true
to the authority of the Church of England, with no prejudice against
the ancient Catholic faith.&nbsp; As Gesner was his authority for pickerel
weed begetting pike, so the Anglican bishops were security for Walton&rsquo;s
creed.</p>
<p>To him, if we may say so, it was easy to be saved, while Bunyan,
a greater humorist, could be saved only in following a path that skirted
madness, and &lsquo;as by fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; To Bunyan, Walton would
have seemed a figure like his own Ignorance; a pilgrim who never stuck
in the Slough of Despond, nor met Apollyon in the Valley of the Shadow,
nor was captive in Doubting Castle, nor stoned in Vanity Fair.&nbsp;
And of Bunyan, Walton would have said that he was among those Nonconformists
who &lsquo;might be sincere, well-meaning men, whose indiscreet zeal
might be so like charity, as thereby to cover a multitude of errors.&rsquo;&nbsp;
To Walton there seemed spiritual solace in remembering &lsquo;that we
have comforted and been helpful to a dejected or distressed family.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Bunyan would have regarded this belief as a heresy, and (theoretically)
charitable deeds &lsquo;as filthy rags.&rsquo;&nbsp; Differently constituted,
these excellent men accepted religion in different ways.&nbsp; Christian
bows beneath a burden of sin; Piscator beneath a basket of trout.&nbsp;
Let us be grateful for the diversities of human nature, and the dissimilar
paths which lead Piscator and Christian alike to the City not built
with hands.&nbsp; Both were seekers for a City which to have sought
through life, in patience, honesty, loyalty, and love, is to have found
it.&nbsp; Of Walton&rsquo;s book we may say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Laudis amore tumes?&nbsp; Sunt certa piacula quae
te<br />
Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>WALTON AS A BIOGRAPHER</h2>
<p>It was probably by his <i>Lives</i>, rather than, in the first instance,
by his <i>Angler</i>, that Walton won the liking of Dr. Johnson, whence
came his literary resurrection.&nbsp; It is true that Moses Browne and
Hawkins, both friends of Johnson&rsquo;s, edited <i>The Compleat Angler</i>
before 1775-1776, when we find Dr. Home of Magdalene, Oxford, contemplating
a &lsquo;benoted&rsquo; edition of the <i>Lives</i>, by Johnson&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; But the Walton of the <i>Lives</i> is, rather than the
Walton of the <i>Angler</i>, the man after Johnson&rsquo;s own heart.&nbsp;
The <i>Angler</i> is &lsquo;a picture of my own disposition&rsquo; on
holidays.&nbsp; The <i>Lives</i> display the same disposition in serious
moods, and in face of the eternal problems of man&rsquo;s life in society.&nbsp;
Johnson, we know, was very fond of biography, had thought much on the
subject, and, as Boswell notes, &lsquo;varied from himself in talk,&rsquo;
when he discussed the measure of truth permitted to biographers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If a man is to write a <i>Panegyrick</i>, he may keep vices out
of sight; but if he professes to write a <i>Life</i>, he must represent
it as it really was.&rsquo;&nbsp; Peculiarities were not to be concealed,
he said, and his own were not veiled by Boswell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody
can write the life of a man but those who have eat and drunk and lived
in social intercourse with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They only who live
with a man can write his life with any genuine exactness and discrimination;
and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Walton had lived much in the society of his subjects, Donne and Wotton;
with Sanderson he had a slighter acquaintance; George Herbert he had
only met; Hooker, of course, he had never seen in the flesh.&nbsp; It
is obvious to every reader that his biographies of Donne and Wotton
are his best.&nbsp; In Donne&rsquo;s Life he feels that he is writing
of an English St. Austin,&mdash;&lsquo;for I think none was so like
him before his conversion; none so like St. Ambrose after it: and if
his youth had the infirmities of the one, his age had the excellencies
of the other; the learning and holiness of both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Augustine made free confession of his own infirmities of youth.&nbsp;
With great delicacy Walton lets Donne also confess himself, printing
a letter in which he declines to take Holy Orders, because his course
of life when very young had been too notorious.&nbsp; Delicacy and tact
are as notable in Walton&rsquo;s account of Donne&rsquo;s poverty, melancholy,
and conversion through the blessed means of gentle King Jamie.&nbsp;
Walton had an awful loyalty, a sincere reverence for the office of a
king.&nbsp; But wherever he introduces King James, either in his Donne
or his Wotton, you see a subdued version of the King James of <i>The
Fortunes of Nigel</i>.&nbsp; The pedantry, the good nature, the touchiness,
the humour, the nervousness, are all here.&nbsp; It only needs a touch
of the king&rsquo;s broad accent to set before us, as vividly as in
Scott, the interviews with Donne, and that singular scene when Wotton,
disguised as Octavio Baldi, deposits his long rapier at the door of
his majesty&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; Wotton, in Florence, was warned of
a plot to murder James VI.&nbsp; The duke gave him &lsquo;such Italian
antidotes against poison as the Scots till then had been strangers to&rsquo;:
indeed, there is no antidote for a dirk, and the Scots were not poisoners.&nbsp;
Introduced by Lindsay as &lsquo;Octavio Baldi,&rsquo; Wotton found his
nervous majesty accompanied by four Scottish nobles.&nbsp; He spoke
in Italian; then, drawing near, hastily whispered that he was an Englishman,
and prayed for a private interview.&nbsp; This, by some art, he obtained,
delivered his antidotes, and, when James succeeded Elizabeth, rose to
high favour.&nbsp; Izaak&rsquo;s suppressed humour makes it plain that
Wotton had acted the scene for him, from the moment of leaving the long
rapier at the door.&nbsp; Again, telling how Wotton, in his peaceful
hours as Provost of Eton, intended to write a Life of Luther, he says
that King Charles diverted him from his purpose to attempting a History
of England &lsquo;by a persuasive loving violence (to which may be added
a promise of &pound;500 a year).&rsquo;&nbsp; He likes these parenthetic
touches, as in his description of Donne, &lsquo;always preaching to
himself, like an angel from a cloud,&mdash;<i>but in none</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Again, of a commendation of one of his heroes he says, &lsquo;it is
a known truth,&mdash;though it be in verse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A memory of the days when Izaak was an amorist, and shone in love
ditties, appears thus.&nbsp; He is speaking of Donne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Love is a flattering mischief . . . a passion
that carries us to commit errors with as much ease as whirlwinds remove
feathers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The tears of lovers, or beauty dressed in sadness, are observed
to have in them a charming sadness, and to become very often too strong
to be resisted.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are examples of Walton&rsquo;s sympathy: his power of portrait-drawing
is especially attested by his study of Donne, as the young gallant and
poet, the unhappy lover, the man of state out of place and neglected;
the heavily burdened father, the conscientious scholar, the charming
yet ascetic preacher and divine, the saint who, dying, makes himself
in his own shroud, an emblem of mortality.</p>
<p>As an example of Walton&rsquo;s style, take the famous vision of
Dr. Donne in Paris.&nbsp; He had left his wife expecting her confinement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Two days after their arrival there, Mr. Donne
was left alone in that room in which Sir Robert and he, and some other
friends, had dined together.&nbsp; To this place Sir Robert returned
within half an hour, and as he left, so he found Mr. Donne alone, but
in such an ecstacy, and so altered as to his looks, as amazed Sir Robert
to behold him; insomuch that he earnestly desired Mr. Donne to declare
what had befallen him in the short time of his absence.&nbsp; To which
Mr. Donne was not able to make a present answer: but, after a long and
perplexed pause, did at last say, &ldquo;I have seen a dreadful vision
since I saw you: I have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this
room, with her hair hanging about her shoulders, and a dead child in
her arms; this I have seen since I saw you.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which Sir
Robert replied, &ldquo;Sure, sir, you have slept since I saw you; and
this is the result of some melancholy dream, which I desire you to forget,
for you are now awake.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which Mr. Donne&rsquo;s reply
was, &ldquo;I cannot be surer that I now live than that I have not slept
since I saw you: and I am as sure that at her second appearing she stopped,
and looked me in the face, and vanished . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; And upon
examination, the abortion proved to be the same day, and about the very
hour, that Mr. Donne affirmed he saw her pass by him in his chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo; . . . And though it is most certain that two lutes, being
both strung and tuned to an equal pitch, and then one played upon, the
other, that is not touched, being laid upon a table at a fit distance,
will (like an echo to a trumpet) warble a faint audible harmony in answer
to the same tune; yet many will not believe there is any such thing
as a sympathy of souls, and I am well pleased that every reader do enjoy
his own opinion . . . &rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then appeals to authority, as of Brutus, St. Monica, Saul, St.
Peter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;More observations of this nature, and inferences
from them, might be made to gain the relation a firmer belief; but I
forbear: lest I, that intended to be but a relator, may be thought to
be an engaged person for the proving what was related to me, . . . by
one who had it from Dr. Donne.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walpole was no Boswell; worthy Boswell would have cross-examined
Dr. Donne himself.</p>
<p>Of dreams he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Common dreams are but a senseless paraphrase on
our waking thoughts, or of the business of the day past, or are the
result of our over engaged affections when we betake ourselves to rest.&rsquo;
. . . Yet &lsquo;Almighty God (though the causes of dreams be often
unknown) hath even in these latter times also, by a certain illumination
of the soul in sleep, discovered many things that human wisdom could
not foresee.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walton is often charged with superstition, and the enlightened editor
of the eighteenth century excised all the scene of Mrs. Donne&rsquo;s
wraith as too absurd.&nbsp; But Walton is a very fair witness.&nbsp;
Donne, a man of imagination, was, he tells us, in a perturbed anxiety
about Mrs. Donne.&nbsp; The event was after dinner.&nbsp; The story
is, by Walton&rsquo;s admission, at second hand.&nbsp; Thus, in the
language of the learned in such matters, the tale is &lsquo;not evidential.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Walton explains it, if true, as a result of &lsquo;sympathy of souls&rsquo;&mdash;what
is now called telepathy.&nbsp; But he is content that every man should
have his own opinion.&nbsp; In the same way he writes of the seers in
the Wotton family: &lsquo;God did seem to speak to many of this family&rsquo;
(the Wottons) &lsquo;in dreams,&rsquo; and Thomas Wotton&rsquo;s dreams
&lsquo;did usually prove true, both in foretelling things to come, and
discovering things past.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus he dreamed that five townsmen
and poor scholars were robbing the University chest at Oxford.&nbsp;
He mentioned this in a letter to his son at Oxford, and the letter,
arriving just after the robbery, led to the discovery of the culprits.&nbsp;
Yet Walton states the causes and nature of dreams in general with perfect
sobriety and clearness.&nbsp; His tales of this sort were much to Johnson&rsquo;s
mind, as to Southey&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But Walton cannot fairly be called
&lsquo;superstitious,&rsquo; granting the age in which he lived.&nbsp;
Visions like Dr. Donne&rsquo;s still excite curious comment.</p>
<p>To that cruel superstition of his age, witchcraft, I think there
is no allusion in Walton.&nbsp; Almost as uncanny, however, is his account
of Donne&rsquo;s preparation for death</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Several charcoal fires being first made in his
large study, he brought with him into that place his winding-sheet in
his hand, and having put off all his clothes, had this sheet put on
him, and so tied with knots at his head and feet, and his hands so placed
as dead bodies are usually fitted, to be shrouded and put into their
coffin or grave.&nbsp; Upon this urn he thus stood, with his eyes shut,
and with so much of the sheet turned aside as might show his lean, pale,
and death-like face, which was purposely turned towards the east, from
which he expected the second coming of his and our Saviour Jesus.&nbsp;
In this posture he was drawn at his just height, and, when the picture
was fully finished, he caused it to be set by his bedside, where it
continued, and became his hourly object till death.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Donne made ready to meet the common fate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;That body, which once was a temple of the Holy
Ghost, is now become a small quantity of Christian ashes.&nbsp; But
I shall see it reanimated.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the very voice of Faith.&nbsp; Walton was, indeed, an assured
believer, and to his mind, the world offered no insoluble problem.&nbsp;
But we may say of him, in the words of a poet whom he quotes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Many a one<br />
Owes to his country his religion;<br />
And in another would as strongly grow<br />
Had but his nurse or mother taught him so.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his account of Donne&rsquo;s early theological studies of the
differences between Rome and Anglicanism, it is manifest that Izaak
thinks these differences matters of no great moment.&nbsp; They are
not for simple men to solve: Donne has taken that trouble for him; besides,
he is an Englishman, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Owes to his country his religion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He will be no Covenanter, and writes with disgust of an intruded
Scots minister, whose first action was to cut down the ancient yews
in the churchyard.&nbsp; Izaak&rsquo;s religion, and all his life, were
rooted in the past, like the yew-tree.&nbsp; He is what he calls &lsquo;the
passive peaceable Protestant.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The common people
in this nation,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;think they are not wise unless
they be busy about what they understand not, and especially about religion&rsquo;;
as Bunyan was busy at that very moment.&nbsp; In Walton&rsquo;s opinion,
the plain facts of religion, and of consequent morality, are visible
as the sun at noonday.&nbsp; The vexed questions are for the learned,
and are solved variously by them.&nbsp; A man must follow authority,
as he finds it established in his own country, unless he has the learning
and genius of a Donne.&nbsp; To these, or equivalents for these in a
special privy inspiration, &lsquo;the common people&rsquo; of his day,
and ever since Elizabeth&rsquo;s day, were pretending.&nbsp; This was
the inevitable result of the translation of the Bible into English.&nbsp;
Walton quotes with approval a remark of a witty Italian on a populace
which was universally occupied with Free-will and Predestination.&nbsp;
The fruits Walton saw, in preaching Corporals, Antinomian Trusty Tompkinses,
Quakers who ran about naked, barking, Presbyterians who cut down old
yew-trees, and a Parliament of Saints.&nbsp; Walton took no kind of
joy in the general emancipation of the human spirit.&nbsp; The clergy,
he confessed, were not what he wished them to be, but they were better
than Quakers, naked and ululant.&nbsp; To love God and his neighbour,
and to honour the king, was Walton&rsquo;s unperplexed religion.&nbsp;
Happily he was saved from the view of the errors and the fall of James
II., a king whom it was not easy to honour.&nbsp; His social philosophy
was one of established rank, tempered by equity and Christian charity.&nbsp;
If anything moves his tranquil spirit, it is the remorseless greed of
him who takes his fellow-servant by the throat and exacts the uttermost
penny.&nbsp; How Sanderson saved a poor farmer from the greed of an
extortionate landlord, Walton tells in his Life of the prelate, adding
this reflection:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It may be noted that in this age there are a sort
of people so unlike the God of mercy, so void of the bowels of pity,
that they love only themselves and their children; love them so as not
to be concerned whether the rest of mankind waste their days in sorrow
or shame; people that are cursed with riches, and a mistake that nothing
but riches can make them and theirs happy.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Walton appears, this is &lsquo;the picture of his own disposition,&rsquo;
in the <i>Lives</i>.&nbsp; He is a kind of antithesis to John Knox.&nbsp;
Men like Walton are not to be approached for new &lsquo;ideas.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They will never make a new world at a blow: they will never enable us
to understand, but they can teach us to endure, and even to enjoy, the
world.&nbsp; Their example is alluring:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Even the ashes of the just<br />
Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE COMPLEAT ANGLER</h2>
<p>Franck, as we saw, called Walton &lsquo;a plagiary.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He was a plagiary in the same sense as Virgil and Lord Tennyson and
Robert Burns, and, indeed, Homer, and all poets.&nbsp; <i>The Compleat
Angler</i>, the father of so many books, is the child of a few.&nbsp;
Walton not only adopts the opinions and advice of the authors whom he
cites, but also follows the manner, to a certain extent, of authors
whom he does not quote.&nbsp; His very exordium, his key-note, echoes
(as Sir Harris Nicolas observes) the opening of <i>A Treatise of the
Nature of God</i> (London, 1599).&nbsp; The <i>Treatise</i> starts with
a conversation between a gentleman and a scholar: it commences:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Gent</i>.&nbsp; Well overtaken, sir!</p>
<p><i>Scholar</i>.&nbsp; You are welcome, gentleman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more important source is <i>The Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle</i>,
commonly attributed to Dame Juliana Barnes (printed at Westminster,
1496).&nbsp; A manuscript, probably of 1430-1450, has been published
by Mr. Satchell (London, 1883).&nbsp; This book may be a translation
of an unknown French original.&nbsp; It opens:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Soloman in hys paraboles seith that a glad spirit
maket a flowryng age.&nbsp; That ys to sey, a feyre age and a longe&rsquo;
(like Walton&rsquo;s own), &lsquo;and sith hyt ys so I aske this question,
wyche bynne the menys and cause to reduce a man to a mery spryte.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The angler &lsquo;schall have hys holsom walke and mery at hys owne
ease, and also many a sweyt eayr of divers erbis and flowres that schall
make hym ryght hongre and well disposed in hys body.&nbsp; He schall
heyr the melodies melodious of the ermony of byrde: he schall se also
the yong swannes and signetes folowing ther eyrours, duckes, cootes,
herons, and many other fowlys with ther brodys, wyche me semyt better
then all the noyse of houndes, and blastes of hornes and other gamys
that fawkners or hunters can make, and yf the angler take the fyssche,
hardly then ys ther no man meryer then he in his sprites.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the very &lsquo;sprite&rsquo; of Walton; this has that vernal
and matutinal air of opening European literature, full of birds&rsquo;
music, and redolent of dawn.&nbsp; This is the note to which the age
following Walton would not listen.</p>
<p>In matter of fact, again, Izaak follows the ancient <i>Treatise</i>.&nbsp;
We know his jury of twelve flies: the <i>Treatise</i> says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;These ben the xij flyes wyth whyche ye shall angle
to the trought and graylling, and dubbe like as ye shall now here me
tell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Marche</i>.&nbsp; The donne fly, the body of the donne
woll, and the wyngis of the pertryche.&nbsp; Another donne flye, the
body of blacke woll, the wyngis of the blackyst drake; and the lay under
the wynge and under the tayle.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walton has:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The first is the dun fly in March: the body is
made of dun wool, the wings of the partridge&rsquo;s feathers.&nbsp;
The second is another dun fly: the body of black wool; and the wings
made of the black drake&rsquo;s feathers, and of the feathers under
his tail.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the <i>Treatise</i> has:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Auguste</i>.&nbsp; The drake fly.&nbsp; The body of
black wull and lappyd abowte wyth blacke sylke: winges of the mayle
of the blacke drake wyth a blacke heed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walton has:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The twelfth is the dark drake-fly, good in August:
the body made with black wool, lapt about with black silk, his wings
are made with the mail of the black drake, with a black head.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is word for word a transcript of the fifteenth century <i>Treatise</i>.&nbsp;
But Izaak cites, not the ancient <i>Treatise</i>, but Mr. Thomas Barker.
<a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a>&nbsp; Barker, in
fact, gives many more, and more variegated flies than Izaak offers in
the jury of twelve which he rendered, from the old <i>Treatise</i>,
into modern English.&nbsp; Sir Harris Nicolas says that the jury is
from Leonard Mascall&rsquo;s <i>Booke of Fishing with Hooke and Line</i>
(London, 1609), but Mascall merely stole from the fifteenth-century
book.&nbsp; In Cotton&rsquo;s practice, and that of <i>The Angler&rsquo;s
Vade Mecum</i> (1681), flies were as numerous as among ourselves, and
had, in many cases, the same names.&nbsp; Walton absurdly bids us &lsquo;let
no part of the line touch the water, but the fly only.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Barker says, &lsquo;Let the fly light first into the water.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Both men insist on fishing down stream, which is, of course, the opposite
of the true art, for fish lie with their heads up stream, and trout
are best approached from behind.&nbsp; Cotton admits of fishing both
up and down, as the wind and stream may serve: and, of course, in heavy
water, in Scotland, this is all very well.&nbsp; But none of the old
anglers, to my knowledge, was a dry-fly fisher, and Izaak was no fly-fisher
at all.&nbsp; He took what he said from Mascall, who took it from the
old <i>Treatise</i>, in which, it is probable, Walton read, and followed
the pleasant and to him congenial spirit of the medi&aelig;val angler.&nbsp;
All these writers tooled with huge rods, fifteen or eighteen feet in
length, and Izaak had apparently never used a reel.&nbsp; For salmon,
he says, &lsquo;some use a wheel about the middle of their rods or near
their hand, which is to be observed better by seeing one of them, than
by a large demonstration of words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Westwood has made a catalogue of books cited by Walton in his
<i>Compleat Angler</i>.&nbsp; There is &AElig;lian (who makes the first
known reference to fly-fishing); Aldrovandus, <i>De Piscibus</i> (1638);
Dubravius, <i>De Piscibus</i> (1559); and the English translation (1599)
Gerard&rsquo;s <i>Herball</i> (1633); Gesner, <i>De Piscibus</i> (<i>s.a</i>.)
and <i>Historia Naturalis</i> (1558); Phil. Holland&rsquo;s <i>Pliny</i>
(1601); Rondelet, <i>De Piscibus Marines</i> (1554); Silvianus <i>Aquatilium
Histori&aelig;</i> (1554): these nearly exhaust Walton&rsquo;s supply
of authorities in natural history.&nbsp; He was devoted, as we saw,
to authority, and had a childlike faith in the fantastic theories which
date from Pliny.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pliny hath an opinion that many flies
have their birth, or being, from a dew that in the spring falls upon
the leaves of trees.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a pious opinion!&nbsp; Izaak
is hardly so superstitious as the author of <i>The Angler&rsquo;s Vade
Mecum</i>.&nbsp; I cannot imagine him taking &lsquo;Man&rsquo;s fat
and cat&rsquo;s fat, of each half an ounce, mummy finely powdered, three
drains,&rsquo; and a number of other abominations, to &lsquo;make an
Oyntment according to Art, and when you Angle, anoint 8 inches of the
line next the Hook therewith.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or, &lsquo;Take the Bones
and Scull of a Dead-man, at the opening of a Grave, and beat the same
into Pouder, and put of this Pouder in the Moss wherein you keep your
Worms,&mdash;<i>but others like Grave Earth as well</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
No doubt grave earth is quite as efficacious.</p>
<p>These remarks show how Izaak was equipped in books and in practical
information: it follows that his book is to be read, not for instruction,
but for human pleasure.</p>
<p>So much for what Walton owed to others.&nbsp; For all the rest, for
what has made him the favourite of schoolboys and sages, of poets and
philosophers, he is indebted to none but his Maker and his genius.&nbsp;
That he was a lover of Montaigne we know; and, had Montaigne been a
fisher, he might have written somewhat like Izaak, but without the piety,
the perfume, and the charm.&nbsp; There are authors whose living voices,
if we know them in the flesh, we seem to hear in our ears as we peruse
their works.&nbsp; Of such was Mr. Jowett, sometime Master of Balliol
College, a good man, now with God.&nbsp; It has ever seemed to me that
friends of Walton must thus have heard his voice as they read him, and
that it reaches us too, though faintly.&nbsp; Indeed, we have here &lsquo;a
kind of picture of his own disposition,&rsquo; as he tells us Piscator
is the Walton whom honest Nat. and R. Roe and Sir Henry Wotton knew
on fishing-days.&nbsp; The book is a set of confessions, without their
commonly morbid turn.&nbsp; &lsquo;I write not for money, but for pleasure,&rsquo;
he says; methinks he drove no hard bargain with good Richard Marriott,
nor was careful and troubled about royalties on his eighteenpenny book.&nbsp;
He regards scoffers as &lsquo;an abomination to mankind,&rsquo; for
indeed even Dr. Johnson, who, a century later, set Moses Browne on reprinting
<i>The Compleat Angler</i>, broke his jest on our suffering tribe.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Many grave, serious men pity anglers,&rsquo; says Auceps, and
Venator styles them &lsquo;patient men,&rsquo; as surely they have great
need to be.&nbsp; For our toil, like that of the husbandman, hangs on
the weather that Heaven sends, and on the flies that have their birth
or being from a kind of dew, and on the inscrutable caprice of fish;
also, in England, on the miller, who giveth or withholdeth at his pleasure
the very water that is our element.&nbsp; The inquiring rustic who shambles
up erect when we are lying low among the reeds, even he disposes of
our fortunes, with whom, as with all men, we must be patient, dwelling
ever&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;With close-lipped Patience for our only friend,<br />
Sad Patience, too near neighbour of Despair.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O the tangles, more than Gordian, of gut on a windy day!&nbsp; O
bitter east wind that bloweth down stream!&nbsp; O the young ducks that,
swimming between us and the trout, contend with him for the blue duns
in their season!&nbsp; O the hay grass behind us that entangles the
hook!&nbsp; O the rocky wall that breaks it, the boughs that catch it;
the drought that leaves the salmon-stream dry, the floods that fill
it with turbid, impossible waters!&nbsp; Alas for the knot that breaks,
and for the iron that bends; for the lost landing-net, and the gillie
with the gaff that scrapes the fish!&nbsp; Izaak believed that fish
could hear; if they can, their vocabulary must be full of strange oaths,
for all anglers are not patient men.&nbsp; A malison on the trout that
&lsquo;bulge&rsquo; and &lsquo;tail,&rsquo; on the salmon that &lsquo;jiggers,&rsquo;
or sulks, or lightly gambols over and under the line.&nbsp; These things,
and many more, we anglers endure meekly, being patient men, and a light
world fleers at us for our very virtue.</p>
<p>Izaak, of course, justifies us by the example of the primitive Christians,
and, in the manner of the age, drowns opposition in a flood of erudition,
out of place, but never pedantic; futile, yet diverting; erroneous,
but not dull.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God is said to have spoken to a fish, but never to a beast.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is a modern Greek phrase, &lsquo;By the first word of God, and
the second of the fish.&rsquo;&nbsp; As for angling, &lsquo;it is somewhat
like poetry: men are to be born so&rsquo;; and many are born to be both
rhymers and anglers.&nbsp; But, unlike many poets, the angler resembles
&lsquo;the Adonis, or Darling of the Sea, so called because it is a
loving and innocent fish,&rsquo; and a peaceful; &lsquo;and truly, I
think most anglers are so disposed to most of mankind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our Saviour&rsquo;s peculiar affection for fishermen is, of course,
a powerful argument.&nbsp; And it is certain that Peter, James, and
John made converts among the twelve, for &lsquo;the greater number of
them were found together, fishing, by Jesus after His Resurrection.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That Amos was &lsquo;a good-natured, plain fisherman,&rsquo; only Walton
had faith enough to believe.&nbsp; He fixes gladly on mentions of hooks
in the Bible, omitting Homer, and that excellent Theocritean dialogue
of the two old anglers and the fish of gold, which would have delighted
Izaak, had he known it; but he was no great scholar.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
let me tell you that in the Scripture, angling is always taken in the
best sense,&rsquo; though Izaak does not dwell on Tobias&rsquo;s enormous
capture.&nbsp; So he ends with commendations of angling by Wotton, and
Davors (Dennys, more probably) author of <i>The Secrets of Angling</i>
(1613).&nbsp; To these we may add Wordsworth, Thomson, Scott, Hogg,
Stoddart, and many minor poets who loved the music of the reel.</p>
<p>Izaak next illustrates his idea of becoming mirth, which excludes
&lsquo;Scripture jests and lascivious jests,&rsquo; both of them highly
distasteful to anglers.&nbsp; Then he comes to practice, beginning with
chub, for which I have never angled, but have taken them by misadventure,
with a salmon fly.&nbsp; Thence we proceed to trout, and to the charming
scene of the milkmaid and her songs by Raleigh and Marlowe, &lsquo;I
think much better than the strong lines that are now in fashion in this
critical age,&rsquo; for Walton, we have said, was the last of the Elizabethans
and the new times were all for Waller and Dryden.&nbsp; &lsquo;Chevy
Chace&rsquo; and &lsquo;Johnny Armstrong&rsquo; were dear to Walton
as to Scott, but through a century these old favourites were to be neglected,
save by Mr. Pepys and Addison.&nbsp; Indeed, there is no more curious
proof of the great unhappy change then coming to make poetry a mechanic
art, than the circumstance that Walton is much nearer to us, in his
likings, than to the men between 1670 and 1770.&nbsp; Gay was to sing
of angling, but in &lsquo;the strong lines that are now in fashion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
All this while Piscator has been angling with worm and minnow to no
purpose, though he picks up &lsquo;a trout will fill six reasonable
bellies&rsquo; in the evening.&nbsp; So we leave them, after their ale,
in fresh sheets that smell of lavender.&rsquo;&nbsp; Izaak&rsquo;s practical
advice is not of much worth; we read him rather for sentences like this:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, scholar: when I sat last on this primrose
bank, and looked down these meadows, I thought of them as Charles the
Emperor did of the city of Florence, &ldquo;that they were too pleasant
to be looked upon, but only on holy-days.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; He did
not say, like Fox, when Burke spoke of &lsquo;a seat under a tree, with
a friend, a bottle, and a book,&rsquo; &lsquo;Why a book?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Izaak took his book with him&mdash;a practice in which, at least, I
am fain to imitate this excellent old man.</p>
<p>As to salmon, Walton scarcely speaks a true word about their habits,
except by accident.&nbsp; Concerning pike, he quotes the theory that
they are bred by pickerel weed, only as what &lsquo;some think.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In describing the use of frogs as bait, he makes the famous, or infamous,
remark, &lsquo;Use him as though you loved him . . . that he may live
the longer.&rsquo;&nbsp; A bait-fisher <i>may</i> be a good man, as
Izaak was, but it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle.&nbsp; As coarse fish are usually caught only with bait, I shall
not follow Izaak on to this unholy and unfamiliar ground, wherein, none
the less, grow flowers of Walton&rsquo;s fancy, and the songs of the
old poets are heard.&nbsp; <i>The Practical Angler</i>, indeed, is a
book to be marked with flowers, marsh marigolds and fritillaries, and
petals of the yellow iris, for the whole provokes us to content, and
whispers that word of the apostle, &lsquo;Study to be quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>FISHING THEN AND NOW</h2>
<p>Since Maui, the Maori hero, invented barbs for hooks, angling has
been essentially one and the same thing.&nbsp; South Sea islanders spin
for fish with a mother-of-pearl lure which is also a hook, and answers
to our spoon.&nbsp; We have hooks of stone, and hooks of bone; and a
bronze hook, found in Ireland, has the familiar Limerick bend.&nbsp;
What Homer meant by making anglers throw &lsquo;the horn of an ox of
the stall&rsquo; into the sea, we can only guess; perhaps a horn minnow
is meant, or a little sheath of horn to protect the line.&nbsp; Dead
bait, live bait, and imitations of bait have all been employed, and
&AElig;lian mentions artificial Mayflies used, with a very short line,
by the Illyrians.</p>
<p>But, while the same in essence, angling has been improved by human
ingenuity.&nbsp; The Waltonian angler, and still more his English predecessors,
dealt much in the home-made.&nbsp; The <i>Treatise</i> of the fifteenth
century bids you make your &lsquo;Rodde&rsquo; of a fair staff even
of a six foot long or more, as ye list, of hazel, willow, or &lsquo;aspe&rsquo;
(ash?), and &lsquo;beke hym in an ovyn when ye bake, and let him cool
and dry a four weeks or more.&rsquo;&nbsp; The pith is taken out of
him with a hot iron, and a yard of white hazel is similarly treated,
also a fair shoot of blackthorn or crabtree for a top.&nbsp; The butt
is bound with hoops of iron, the top is accommodated with a noose, a
hair line is looped in the noose, and the angler is equipped.&nbsp;
Splicing is not used, but the joints have holes to receive each other,
and with this instrument &lsquo;ye may walk, and there is no man shall
wit whereabout ye go.&rsquo;&nbsp; Recipes are given for colouring and
plaiting hair lines, and directions for forging hooks.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
smallest quarell needles&rsquo; are used for the tiniest hooks.</p>
<p>Barker (1651) makes the rod &lsquo;of a hasel of one piece, or of
two pieces set together in the most convenient manner, light and gentle.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He recommends the use of a single hair next the fly,&mdash;&lsquo;you
shall have more rises,&rsquo; which is true, &lsquo;and kill more fish,&rsquo;
which is not so likely.&nbsp; The most delicate striking is required
with fine gut, and with a single hair there must be many breakages.&nbsp;
For salmon, Barker uses a rod ten feet in the butt, &lsquo;that will
carry a top of six foot pretty stiffe and strong.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;winder,&rsquo;
or reel, Barker illustrates with a totally unintelligible design.&nbsp;
His salmon fly &lsquo;carries six wings&rsquo;; perhaps he only means
wings composed of six kinds of feathers, but here Franck is a better
authority, his flies being sensible and sober in colour.&nbsp; Not many
old salmon flies are in existence, nor have I seen more ancient specimens
than a few, chiefly of peacocks&rsquo; feathers, in the fly-leaf of
a book at Abbotsford; they were used in Ireland by Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
eldest son.&nbsp; The controversy as to whether fish can distinguish
colours was unknown to our ancestors.&nbsp; I am inclined to believe
that, for salmon, size, and perhaps shade, light or dark, with more
or less of tinsel, are the only important points.&nbsp; Izaak stumbled
on the idea of Mr. Stewart (author of <i>The Practical Angler</i>) saying,
&lsquo;for the generality, three or four flies, neat, and rightly made,
and not too big, serve for a trout in most rivers, all the summer.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Our ancestors, though they did not fish with the dry fly, were intent
on imitating the insect on the water.&nbsp; As far as my own experience
goes, if trout are feeding on duns, one dun will take them as well as
another, if it be properly presented.&nbsp; But my friend Mr. Charles
Longman tells me that, after failing with two trout, he examined the
fly on the water, an olive dun, and found in his book a fly which exactly
matched the natural insect in colour.&nbsp; With this he captured his
brace.</p>
<p>Such incidents look as if trout were particular to a shade, but we
can never be certain that the angler did not make an especially artful
and delicate cast when he succeeded.&nbsp; Sir Herbert Maxwell intends
to make the experiment of using duns of impossible and unnatural colours;
if he succeeds with these, on several occasions, as well as with orthodox
flies, perhaps we may decide that trout do not distinguish hues.&nbsp;
On a Sutherland loch, an angler found that trout would take flies of
any colour, except that of a light-green leaf of a tree.&nbsp; This
rejection decidedly looked as if even Sutherland loch trout exercised
some discrimination.&nbsp; Often, on a loch, out of three flies they
will favour one, and that, perhaps, not the trail fly.&nbsp; The best
rule is: when you find a favourite fly on a salmon river, use it: its
special favouritism may be a superstition, but, at all events, salmon
do take it.&nbsp; We cannot afford to be always making experiments,
but Mr. Herbert Spencer, busking his flies the reverse way, used certainly
to be at least as successful with sea trout as his less speculative
neighbours in Argyllshire.</p>
<p>In making rods, Walton is most concerned with painting them; &lsquo;I
think a good top is worth preserving, or I had not taken care to keep
a top above twenty years.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cotton prefers rods &lsquo;made
in Yorkshire,&rsquo; having advanced from the home-made stage.&nbsp;
His were spliced, and kept up all through the season, as he had his
water at his own door, while Walton trudged to the Lee and other streams
near London, when he was not fishing the Itchen, or Shawford Brook.&nbsp;
<i>The Angler&rsquo;s Vade Mecum</i> recommends eighteen-feet rods:
preferring a fir butt, fashioned by the arrow-maker, a hazel top, and
a tip of whalebone.&nbsp; This authority, even more than Walton, deals
in mysterious &lsquo;Oyntments&rsquo; of gum ivy, horse-leek, asafoetida,
man&rsquo;s fat, cat&rsquo;s fat, powdered skulls, and grave earth.&nbsp;
A ghoulish body is the angler of the <i>Vade Mecum</i>.&nbsp; He recommends
up-stream fishing, with worm, in a clear water, and so is a predecessor
of Mr. Stewart.&nbsp; &lsquo;When you have hooked a good fish, have
an especial care to keep the rod bent, lest he run to the end of the
line&rsquo; (he means, as does Walton, lest he pull the rod horizontal)
&lsquo;and break either hook or hold.&rsquo;&nbsp; An old owner of my
copy adds, in manuscript, &lsquo;And hale him not to near ye top of
the water, lest in flaskering he break ye line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a favourite device of sea trout, which are very apt to &lsquo;flasker&rsquo;
on the top of the water.&nbsp; The <i>Vade Mecum</i>, in advance of
Walton on this point, recommends a swivel in minnow-fishing: but has
no idea of an artificial minnow of silk.&nbsp; I have known an ingenious
lady who, when the bodies of her phantom minnows gave out, in Norway,
supplied their place successfully with bed-quilting artfully sewn.&nbsp;
In fact, anything bright and spinning will allure fish, though in the
upper Ettrick, where large trout exist, they will take the natural,
but perhaps never the phantom or angel minnow.&nbsp; I once tried a
spinning Alexandra fly over some large pond trout.&nbsp; They followed
it eagerly, but never took hold, on the first day; afterwards they would
not look at it at all.&nbsp; The <i>Vade Mecum</i> man, like Dr. Hamilton,
recommends a light fly for a light day, a dark fly for a dark day and
dark weather; others hold the converse opinion.&nbsp; Every one agrees
that the smallness of the flies should be in proportion to the lowness
of the water and the advance of summer. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a></p>
<p>Our ancestors, apparently, used only one fly at a time; in rapid
rivers, with wet fly, two, three, or, in lochs like Loch Leven, even
four are employed.&nbsp; To my mind more than two only cause entanglements
of the tackle.&nbsp; The old English anglers knew, of course, little
or nothing of loch fishing, using bait in lakes.&nbsp; The great length
of their rods made reels less necessary, and they do not seem to have
waded much.&nbsp; A modern angler, casting upwards, from the middle
of the stream, with a nine-foot rod, would have astonished Walton.&nbsp;
They dealt with trout less educated than ours, and tooled with much
coarser and heavier implements.&nbsp; They had no fine scruples about
bait of every kind, any more than the Scots have, and Barker loved a
lob-worm, fished on the surface, in a dark night.&nbsp; He was a pot-fisher,
and had been a cook.&nbsp; He could catch a huge basket of trout, and
dress them in many different ways,&mdash;broyled, calvored hot with
antchovaes sauce, boyled, soused, stewed, fried, battered with eggs,
roasted, baked, calvored cold, and marilled, or potted, also marrionated.&nbsp;
Barker instructs my Lord Montague to fish with salmon roe, a thing prohibited
and very popular in Scotland.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had known it but twenty
years agoe, I would have gained a hundred pounds onely with that bait.&nbsp;
I am bound in duty to divulge it to your Honour, and not to carry it
to my grave with me.&nbsp; I do desire that men of quality should have
it that delight in that pleasure: the greedy angler will murmur at me,
but for that I care not.&rsquo;&nbsp; Barker calls salmon roe &lsquo;an
experience I have found of late: the best bait for a trout that I have
seen in all my time,&rsquo; and it is the most deadly, in the eddy of
a turbid water.&nbsp; Perhaps trout would take caviare, which is not
forbidden by the law of the land.&nbsp; Any unscrupulous person may
make the experiment, and argue the matter out with the water-bailie.&nbsp;
But, in my country, it is more usual to duck that official, and go on
netting, sniggling, salmon-roeing, and destroying sport in the sacred
name of Liberty.</p>
<blockquote><p>Scots wha fish wi&rsquo; salmon roe,<br />
Scots wha sniggle as ye go,<br />
Wull ye stand the Bailie?&nbsp; No!<br />
Let the limmer die!</p>
<p>Now&rsquo;s the day and now&rsquo;s the time,<br />
Poison a&rsquo; the burns wi&rsquo; lime,<br />
Fishing fair&rsquo;s a dastard crime,<br />
We&rsquo;re for fishing <i>free</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Ydle persones sholde have but lyttyl mesure in the sayd disporte
of fysshyng,&rsquo; says our old <i>Treatise</i>, but in southern Scotland
they have left few fish to dysporte with, and the trout is like to become
an extinct animal.&nbsp; Izaak would especially have disliked Fishing
Competitions, which, by dint of the multitude of anglers, turn the contemplative
man&rsquo;s recreation into a crowded skirmish; and we would repeat
his remark, &lsquo;the rabble herd themselves together&rsquo; (a dozen
in one pool, often), &lsquo;and endeavour to govern and act in spite
of authority.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For my part, had I a river, I would gladly let all honest anglers
that use the fly cast line in it, but, where there is no protection,
then nets, poison, dynamite, slaughter of fingerlings, and unholy baits
devastate the fish, so that &lsquo;Free Fishing&rsquo; spells no fishing
at all.&nbsp; This presses most hardly on the artisan who fishes fair,
a member of a large class with whose pastime only a churl would wish
to interfere.&nbsp; We are now compelled, if we would catch fish, to
seek Tarpon in Florida, Mahseer in India: it does not suffice to &lsquo;stretch
our legs up Tottenham Hill.&rsquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
